# JavaScript-Examples
This repo is based only for some of the examples I made during JavaScript learning.

1.Number Guessing game: Stored in a single file with same name,this file is made for user to guess the randomly generated number according to the hints given in the browser window.


2.Random Story Generator : This example will work on two files (main.js and index.html) for generating a random story each time the user clicks on the button. The US/UK radio buttons can be used to change the measurements provided in the story. User can also enter his name in the story using the top text field.
